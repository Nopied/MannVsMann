# Mann vs. Mann

**A custom Team Fortress 2 gamemode that puts Mann vs. Machine upgrades into regular gameplay.**

Mann vs. Mann was originally created by [Screwdriver](https://github.com/ScrewdriverHyena)
and [Kenzzer](https://github.com/Kenzzer) in 2018 for the Red Sun Over Paradise community. It was ultimately abandoned
and never publicly released due to countless issues.

In April 2021, [Mikusch](https://github.com/Mikusch) decided to completely rewrite the plugin from the ground up with
many needed fixes and additional gameplay elements.

Forked by Nopied, for personal server use only.
